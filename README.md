# meteor-accounts-jwt
This enables logging in to Meteor's user account system with a JSON web token.
The JWT payload is tied to an e-mail address, which allows you to send a login
link that verifies a user's email address before the actual user document is 
created.

Installation
============
`meteor add hackprinceton:accounts-jwt`

Settings
========
This package will check your `settings.json` for config options.

    "JWTLogin": {
      "secret": "some-secret-string",
      "tokenOptions": { ... },  // See below
      "verifyOptions": { ... }  // See below
    }

This package uses https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken for the actual
JWT encoding / decoding. The `tokenOptions` in `settings.json` should
correspond to the options provided to `jwt.sign` while the `verifyOptions`
should correspond to the options provided to `jwt.verify`.

Usage
=====
Call `JWTLogin.getToken(email)` to get a token for a given email address. You
can use this token to construct a special login link for emailing or whatever
else you want.

On the client, call `Accounts.loginWithJWT(token, callback)` to automatically
log a user in with a given token. The callback receives an error on failure
and nothing on success. If the token is for an e-mail address not associated
with a user, the error returned will have its `error` property equal to 404.

When creating a new user, you can pass the token like so to create a user 
with an automatically verified e-mail address:

```javascript
Accounts.createUser({ email: email, password: password, jwt: token }, 
  function(err) {
    // Do something ...
  })
```

If the email provided to `createUser` does not match the e-mail encoded by
the token, the e-mail provided by the token overrides the given e-mail.

Testing
=======

Test with `meteor test-packages ./ --settings test_settings.json`.
